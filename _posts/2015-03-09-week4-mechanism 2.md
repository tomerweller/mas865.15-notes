My Inspiration was this whiteboard clock. I like how the machine does can be easily moved between surfaces and how the control is control mechanism is confined to a small part of the machine.

####Design
For my mechanism I went on an anlog version using manual levers.
#####Arm (x4)
![arm]({{ "/assets/week4/arm.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#####Dock (x2)
![dock]({{ "/assets/week4/dock.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

#####Lever (x2)

#####Construction
0.2" acrylic. laser cut. assembled.

![Animated]({{ "/assets/week4/tomer.gif" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

It's clearly evident that the machine is over constrained and with minimal improvements you can get a better reach

Next steps: 

- calculate boundries. 
- calculate the translation function from X,Y to alpha,beta coordinates.
