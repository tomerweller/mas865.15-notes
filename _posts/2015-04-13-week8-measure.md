For my plotbot I've decided to build a magnetic rotary encoder that can sense a precise angle.

The idea: use 4 hall sensors to magically calculate the exact orientation of the wheel. I was assisted by a sensormag article : ["Understanding Integrated Hall Effect Rotary Encoders"](http://www.sensorsmag.com/sensors/position-presence-proximity/understanding-integrated-hall-effect-rotary-encoders-1254)

####Magnetized Wheel
I started by creating a wheel that has a diametric polarity (one direction is positive and the other is negative).
![wheel]({{ "/assets/week8/wheel.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

####Circuitry
The 4 hall sensors are positioned in the exact distance from the center, offset by 90 degrees from each other.
![circuitry]({{ "/assets/week8/circuitry.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

####Test code

The following code loops over 200 steps which equal 360 degrees. after each step It takes a measurement from all the hall sensors. The output is a simple CSV. 

{% highlight c %}
void loop() {

  if (Serial.available()>0) {
    Serial.read();
    on = !on;
    a = 0;
  }

  if (on && a<200) {
    Serial.print(a++);
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A0));
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A1));
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A2));
    Serial.print(",");
    Serial.print(analogRead(A3));
    Serial.print("\n");
    digitalWrite(stp, HIGH);   
    delay(10);               
    digitalWrite(stp, LOW);  
    delay(10);
  } else {
    delay(20);
  } 
}
{% endhighlight %}

####Run

{% youtube eWVERI42hXk 944â€†1032 %} 

And on the serial monitor:

	step, A0, A1, A2, A3
	0,513,524,528,510
	1,511,526,526,511
	2,511,527,526,509
	3,513,525,528,508
	....
	....
	197,512,524,526,511
	198,511,525,526,512
	199,513,524,528,509

####Math
I imported the above csv into google sheets, replaced steps with angle (steps*1.8) and plotted the table.

I performed basic calibration by offsetting each value to by it's neutral value and normalizing the values between min and max amplitude.

![math3]({{ "/assets/week8/math3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

<iframe width="886" height="502" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f2gUdngYcuNDVBQFWpbrXji2r16SdBwyYYk5nDsCehU/pubchart?oid=2029177222&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>

Given that we know how all these functions behave I could now calculate all the angles (with an offset because I didn't start from an angle of 0)

![functions]({{ "/assets/week8/functions.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Comparing my calculated angle steps to the original angle steps show a variance of 4.702 degrees and a **standard deviation of 2.168 degrees**.

This is not good enough, I then tried to improve this by using more precise analog reads. This is possible with an arduino uno using [oversampling](http://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2014/05/using-arduino-unos-built-in-16-bit-adc.html#.VSyYUBPF_oE). This is a very wasteful procedure so I'll only use it for testing. 

Using an analog oversampling library I recreated the experiment with 14 bit precision and averaged 3 measurements per step.

Going through the entire process again I achieve a variance of 0.130 degrees and **standard deviation of 0.361 degrees**. Not so bad!
